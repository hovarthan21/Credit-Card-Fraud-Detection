#  Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning

Detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning to ensure financial security and prevent unauthorized access.

---

##  Project Overview

This project aims to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using advanced machine learning algorithms. It leverages real-world anonymized data to build and evaluate a classification model capable of identifying potentially fraudulent activity with high accuracy.

##  Features

- âœ… Supervised machine learning classification
- âœ… Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and feature correlation
- âœ… Data balancing using SMOTE
- âœ… Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
- âœ… Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC-AUC
- âœ… Real-time fraud prediction using custom input

##  Model Pipeline

1. Data Preprocessing  
   - Missing value handling  
   - Feature scaling  
   - SMOTE for imbalance handling  

2. Model Training  
   - Logistic Regression  
   - Random Forest  
   - XGBoost  

3. Model Evaluation  
   - Confusion matrix  
   - ROC-AUC curve  
   - Precision/Recall analysis  

4. Streamlit Integration  
   - User inputs transaction data  
   - Model predicts whether it's fraud or not
